![Management Fail](/public/images/dilbert-vision-crop.jpg)

I’ve been listening to The [Personal MBA](http://personalmba.com/) recently.
It's chock-full of great information.
I just finished the section on management & wanted to capture a few notes that I found especially helpful.

The book is a refreshing contrast to many of the management scenarios I’ve experienced.

**Definition** - Management is the act of coordinating a group of people to
achieve a specific goal while accounting for ever present change & uncertainty.

## The 6 Rules of Effective Management

1. **Recruit the smallest group** of people who can accomplish what must be done quickly & with high quality.
*Don’t gloss over recruiting. It is a critical first step to good management.*

2. **Clearly communicate** the desired end result and who is responsible for what.
*Everyone on the team must understand the intent of the project,
the reason why it’s important, and know what specific parts they are individually responsible for.*

3. **Treat people with respect**. Use courtesy & appreciation.
*The more your team works under mutually supportive conditions,
the more likely they will gel and become a cohesive unit that respects you as a leader.*

4. **Create an environment** where everyone can be their most productive... then get out of the way.
*Provide the best equipment & tools. Shield your team from distractions. e.g. Beauracracy & meetings*

5. **Avoid unrealistic expectations** regarding certainty & prediction.
*Create aggressive plans, but remember that they are little more than guesses.*

6. **Measure to verify** what you are doing is working.
*Don’t fall victim to the fallacy that your plan is perfect. It’s not.
It will require constant adjustment, measurement, & learning.*

## Nuggets of Wisdom

* Command & control styles of management cannot compete in the modern workplace.
In fact command & control is a tell-tale sign of poor & ineffective management.

* The best managers don’t act like big-shot executives.
Instead, they are more akin to skilled assistants who support their team in making effective contributions.

* Decisions should be reserved to team members who have the most direct knowledge
& experience regarding the area in question.

* Overreacting to problems is **never** helpful and will only compound the issues.

* Sometimes the best course of action is **no action**.
